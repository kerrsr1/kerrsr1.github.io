This simple dice game, called Left Right Center, was written in C++ as the final project for IT 312. I chose this as one of my artifacts because it demonstrates my skills related to software engineering and design. It takes an object-oriented programming approach by using a Dice and Player class and making use of encapsulation. I enhanced it by rewriting it in Python while also making some improvements on the modularization of it. Specifically, the main() method was simplified to include a game loop (game_loop()), magic numbers were removed by including global variables, and a class called CenterPot was created to hold the chips passed into the center pot. More notably, Python stringdoc comments were added to explain the code and easily allow other programmers to work on the code.

A computer scientist is able to use well-founded and innovative tools for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals, and my ability to write two programs in separate languages that accomplish the same task demonstrate my ability to be flexible in choosing tools to accomplish goals. It also shows a fundamental understanding of overall programming concepts on my part. Having this understanding provides value because it reduces the amount of time necessary to begin using a new language or tool. New tools and techniques come along often, and I value the importance of being familiar with these advancements and open to implementing them. Additonally, I included stringdoc comments in the Python program to further provide industry value because it makes it very clear to other programmers how it works. This not only makes the code more maintainable (even to myself in the future) but demonstrates my ability to work with a team mindset.
